# Weather-Dashboard.io
//User Story
BECAUSE I am working, attend school, and have many hobbies
THEN I want to assure organization through my daily tasks through planning and implimenting for such events.
BECAUSE my tasks may or may not be dependent on the current weather conditions,
THEN I need to make sure the application updates me on the weather forecast and what the conditions will be for the day.

//Description
Weather-Dashboard.io is a highly extensible front-end application that applys local storage, jquery, popup modal, bootstrap, API, and font awesome.

//UI 
The user simply selects the city they wish to view the weather for and to retrieve a forecast from. The search bar is attached to a local database that contains all possible cities that are connected to the Weather API for retrieval. When the city is selected, the form populates to dispaly city forecast, along with interesting facts of the city and a randomly generated image that was either inspired by the city, or contains images of the city itself. That searched city is then saved to the local storage which can then be selected by the user at a later time to recall. If not, the user can simply chose new city to look up instead.

//PROS
** Perfectly uses weather API & a photo API for retrieval of images and facts upon user submission. 
** Able to apply bootstrap as well as personal styling customization to blend together.

//CONS
**Better spacing and layout of the form. 
** Was unable to find API that retrieves UV Index for specific day of specified location.
